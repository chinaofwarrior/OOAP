# Acknowledgements

We are grateful to the ten early full-time members of the Fintechain executive team—fintech philosophers—whose relentless perseverance and exceptional intellect provided the architectural groundwork for Fintechain.

We are grateful to Mr. Bob Crimmins of Startup Haven Ventures, a former philosopher, who shared with the Fintechain team his insights on David Hume’s philosophy, particularly the principle _“Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence” (ECREE)_. By integrating this with his proprietary Groundwork Framework, he enabled Fintechain, at its early stage, to establish a cogent decision-making framework, laying the philosophical foundation for the company’s inception

We are grateful to Mr. Peter Nobel of the Noble Sustainability Trust, whose commitment to impact-driven investing instilled in Fintechain a strong sense of social mission during its early stage

We are grateful to Peter Chen of Nobel Future Group, who made a significant contribution to building Fintechain’s network during its early stage.

We are grateful to Mr. Tom Tognoli of 1Flourish Capital, whose mentoring of the Fintechain founding team on faith-driven entrepreneurship helped establish Fintechain’s core beliefs and infused the company with its most valuable intangible assets.

We are grateful to Mr. Sam Hamilton of Visa, who provided precise guidance on Fintechain’s product strategy for the mid-to-late 2020s (2025–2029) and offered profound advice on the company’s technology stack

We are grateful to Tommas Kang of Finmo, a colleague and fintech expert with experience as a banker, fintech investor, and fintech entrepreneur. His clear and insightful advice on how Fintechain could establish an umbrella strategy had a profound impact on enhancing the strategic focus of the Fintechian team.

We are grateful to Jamie Dimon of JP Morgan, one of the world’s most influential bankers, for his invaluable advice on how Fintechain can co-evolve with the paradigm-shifting digital asset financial infrastructure

We are grateful to Mr. D.A. Wallach, a mission-driven investor, whose experience with early-stage investments in companies such as SpaceX, Facebook, and Ripple provided invaluable guidance to Fintechain on early-stage financing
