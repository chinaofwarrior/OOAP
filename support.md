## Frequently Asked Questions

How can I use the Fint SDK?

You will need a Fint account. Please send a message to [[email protected]](cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.md) to get one.

Why do I need to record a mandate?

A user mandate is recorded and sent to card networks like Visa. This gives the networks visibility into agent-driven credit card usage, which in turn leads to higher authorization rates. It also reduces error rates and lowers the risk of users later disputing the transaction by claiming the agent, not they themselves, made the payment.

Do you work with network tokens?

Yes. We are working on integrating Visa’s new framework for agentic payments, which is utilizing network tokens. Coming soon.
