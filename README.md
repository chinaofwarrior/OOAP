# Fintechain Mission

Fintechain’s mission is to harness modern blockchain and AI infrastructure to lay the foundations of financial inclusion for the mid-21st century.

By uniting 150 fintech experts committed to pushing financial inclusion beyond its current limits, we seek to build civilization-scale infrastructure for the financial world

Fintechain is building a philosophy for the next 20 years of financial inclusion through a problem-oriented approach.

The Fintechain team has brought together hundreds of fintech experts who embrace Problem-Oriented Technique, united by a shared conviction to tackle these challenges one problem at a time.

Fintechain’s 2026 strategy is centered on building a Commerce Agent dedicated to financial inclusion. Using Problem-Oriented Technique as its core methodology, we decompose the challenges of the Commerce Agent into four fundamental problems:

1. The agentic workflow of the Commerce Agent in procurement and supply-side scenarios
2. Interoperability between the Commerce Agent and blockchain systems
3. Fraud detection and risk mitigation for the Commerce Agent
4. The construction of a financial profile for the Commerce Agent, laying the foundation for future credit and lending
